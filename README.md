# Leaflens
Developed a ML-based project that enables users to identify plant diseases by uploading images of affected plant leaves.
Integrated Flask backend with a HTML and CSS frontend to streamline public service access and Js to implement image uploading logic.
Based on the detected disease, the system provides recommendations for pesticides, fertilizers, and other treatment methods.
